AI is slowly eating the world. In this hands-on workshop, we will explore vector databases, embeddings, RAG, and more to understand how we can practically use GenAI in the workplace. 

## What You Can Expect

In this workshop, we will understand React Server Components together while also exploring richer modalities for generative AI (GenAI) applications than just text: we'll explore generative UI (GenUI) using the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction).

## Prerequisites

To help ease us into it, you'll need the following tech installed:

- Node.js + npm
- A terminal
- VS Code or some text editor

We'll explore the rest together.
