Hello Canada! ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

In order to accommodate folks who canâ€™t make it down to Seattle this year, we have great news! CascadiaJS has partnered with VanJS to provide a local satellite event in downtown Vancouver. Weâ€™ll be using the amazing new Tech Collider space at BCITâ€™s downtown campus, so youâ€™ll get all the amazing CascadiaJS talks streamed in live on a massive wall-sized screen, CascadiaJS swag with a made-in-Canada twist, all just a Skytrain or Seabus ride away.

## Location

### Indie Dev Discount

You can qualify for a $100-off Indie Dev discount if you are between jobs, self-employed or work for an educational institution, non-profit organization or company with fewer than 10 employees. Please contact us for more information and a discount code.

### Group Sales and Registration

We ask people to register for their ticket themselves (and not on behalf of someone else) because during the registration process we ask folks to agree to our Code of Conduct and we collect important personal information, such as hoodie sizes and dietary restrictions.
For group/team purchases, please email us at info@cascadiajs.com. We can separate the payment process from the registration process. We can also provide group discounts for groups of 5 or more. Thank you!
