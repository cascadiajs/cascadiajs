### Fellowship Programs

#### Short

Hey { MANAGER }! I just heard about CascadiaJS 2025: a web dev + AI conference in Seattle on September 18th & 19th. It’s covering a lot of the tools hiring managers look for in applicants, and I think would be tremendously useful for the fellows to attend. I’m particularly excited about the talks on new web APIs, fast build systems and AI engineering. Those points come up a lot in interviews and can make the fellows really stand out.
