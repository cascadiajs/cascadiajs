Thanks to our wonderful sponsor [Mastra](https://mastra.ai/), we are offering FREE, professional, on-site child care for kids 10 and under through [A-List Nanny Services](https://www.alistnannyservices.com/). Spots are limited. If you sign-up and decide later that you don't need childcare, please let us know so that we can make that spot available to another family.

You're welcome to drop off and pick up your child at any time during the shifts that you're signed up for. We ask that you take your child during lunch and dinner to give our caregivers a break; exact time TBD. 

<h2 id="location">Location</h2>

The childcare room will be located in Town Hall. We'll announce the exact location closer to the event. 

<h2 id="bring">What to Bring</h2>

Please make sure everything is labeled with your child's name.

* Water bottle or cup
* Favorite toys, games and books (optional)

For babies and toddlers:

* portable crib or mat for naps
* breast milk/formula and bottles (in a cooler or insulated bag if it needs to be kept cool)
* diapers, wipes and a spare set of clothes

<h2 id="meals">Snacks & Meals</h2>

Please indicate on the sign-up form if you're interested in buying a meal ticket for your child, or if you plan to bring their meals. Our menus aren't finalized yet, but a meal ticket would provide a light breakfast (e.g. pastries, yogurt), lunch (e.g. a deli sandwhich, chips and dessert) and dinner (a buffet).  

We ask that you pick up your child during lunch and dinner so that you can provide their meals and allow our caregivers a break. 

We'll provide some nut-free snacks and fruit. Feel free to bring other nut-free snacks that your child enjoys!
