<h2 id="hack-day">Register for the Cascadia AI Hack Day</h2>

We're putting on our first post-conference hackathon! Join your fellow devs for an epic hack day where we'll be diving into what developers can build using AI, Agents and MCP!

It's completely FREE and you don't have to have experience building with AI, but you should be comfortable building software and apps.

<h2 id="cascadia-connect">Make a New Friend!</h2>

Meeting new people at a conference can be tough. We want to make it easier. We launched Cascadia Connect to help connect you with another attendee during the conference — maybe at the Welcome Reception (Sept 17), over coffee, or just to swap notes between talks. Think of it as a low-pressure way to meet one cool new person. You don’t have to be a first-time attendee to join in — everyone’s welcome!

<h2 id="travel">Book Travel & Lodging</h2>

Traveling to Seattle and need to a place to stay while you're in town? Look no further than our Travel Guide for the scoop on hotel discounts and the best way to get to Seattle (hint: it's the Hacker Train).
