<h2 id="complete-registration">Complete Registration</h2>

Use the button below to complete the registration process. You'll need the ticket reference that is attached to the email that you get from Tito when you registered. It is a 4 letter code followed by a number, like <code>ABCD-3</code>.

This will create your official CascadiaJS account and give you access to RSVP links for the post-conference Activity Day and more!

<h2 id="refer-a-friend">Refer a Friend</h2>

We would love your help in spreading the word about CascadiaJS with your friends and colleagues, so we're running a fun referral contest to reward members of our community. Here's how it works:

* When somesone registers for a ticket to CascadiaJS, they can optionally enter the name of the person who referred them.
* We will keep track of all referrals leading up to Sept 17.
* At the Welcome Reception, we'll announce the winners of the contest!

Here's what folks can win:

* Each referral will win a $25 gift certificate
* Top-3 referrers will be invited to our Friends of Cascadia dinner on Sept 18

<h2 id="welcome-reception">RSVP for the Welcome Reception</h2>

If you're planning on joining us on Sept 17 for our Welcome Reception, please RSVP so we can plan appropriately. You'll have a change to pre-checkin to the conference, pick-up your swag and get to know your fellow attendees. We'll have drinks and music, it's the perfect way to kick-off CascadiaJS!

Also, feel free to bring friends! They can purchase drinks from our bar and we'll be raffling off some free passes to the conference.

<h2 id="pre-conf-trainings">Check out the Pre-Conf Trainings</h2>

Prior to the conference, we are teaming up with Eve Porcello (Moon Highway) to provide 3 days of training workshops. You need to purchase these tickets separately.

<h2 id="hack-day">Register for the Cascadia AI Hackathon</h2>

We're putting on our first post-conference hackathon! Join your fellow devs for an epic hack day where we'll be diving into what developers can build using AI, Agents and MCP!

It's completely FREE and you don't have to have experience building with AI, but you should be comfortable building software and apps.

<h2 id="cascadia-connect">Make a New Friend!</h2>

Meeting new people at a conference can be tough. We want to make it easier. We launched Cascadia Connect to help connect you with another attendee during the conference — maybe at the Welcome Reception (Sept 17), over coffee, or just to swap notes between talks. Think of it as a low-pressure way to meet one cool new person. You don’t have to be a first-time attendee to join in — everyone’s welcome!

<h2 id="travel">Book Travel & Lodging</h2>

Traveling to Seattle and need to a place to stay while you're in town? Look no further than our Travel Guide for the scoop on hotel discounts and the best way to get to Seattle (hint: it's the Hacker Train).
