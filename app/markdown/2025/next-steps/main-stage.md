<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

Thanks for joining us to speak at CascadiaJS 2025! ❤️

Below is a checklist of items to take care of before the conference. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need help with anything!

### Speaker Ticket

Make sure to register for your Speaker Ticket, the link should have been provided in an email. 

PLEASE make sure you're registered by August 1st, or we won't be able to order you your hoodie!

### Join the Discord

Please [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/kkYR86GM29) and send a DM to Carter Rabasa so that he can flag you with the "speaker" role. 

* This will give you access to the "Speaker Lounge" in Discord. 
* Discord is also where we will ask our attendees to ask question during and following your talk.

### Travel

Check out our [Travel Guide](/2025/travel) for information on getting to Seattle and where to stay while you're here.

We are budgeting $500 USD to cover airfare ($1000 is you are outside of the US), so please try to stay in this range. Please book your flights ASAP and email carrie@cascadiajs.com your itinerary and let her know your PayPal information for reimbursement.

As you plan your travel, please try to arrive in Seattle no later than 2pm on September 17. We are hosting our Welcome Reception at the conference venue starting at 5pm. It's not mandatory that you attend, but it's nice. 

### Lodging

We will cover 3 nights of lodging at the Hotel Monaco for the nights of September 17 - 19. If you'd like to arrive earlier or depart later, that's totally OK, you'll just need to cover those extra nights. For assistance, contact katelynne.martuscelli@monaco-seattle.com to book those extra nights.

### Corporate Sponsorship

If your employer is covering travel and lodging in exchange for a Community Sponsorship of the conference, please let us know. It takes a village to put on CascadiaJS, and everything helps.

Thanks you to INFINITE RED for helping us out here!

### Talk Length

If you are giving a Main Stage Talk, you will have 25 minutes max. No exceptions.

A few comments about this:

* These are hard limits, and we'll have to cut off your talk if it goes over. So PLEASE rehearse your talk.
* The reason for this is that we need to keep things moving and want to maximize the number of talks we can fit into a day.
* We have also found that shorter talks are often better talks.
* For inspiration on giving an amazing talk in *5 minutes* please check-out [Ignite Seattle](https://igniteseattle.com/about/).


### Slide / Presentation Review

We trust that you are grown-ups and professionals, so we DO NOT NEED TO PRE-APPROVE your slides or presentation.

Make sure, however, to have stuff BACKED UP before you leave for the conference. If your laptop has a misfortune in transit or at Cascadia, we can try to get a "loaner" on which to run your presentation.

<h2 id="giving-your-talk">Giving Your Talk</h2>

### When your talk is scheduled

The official schedule is at: https://cascadiajs.com/2025/schedule. Your green room check-in time is 20 minutes before that, but you're welcome to arrive earlier.

### Tech Specs

You present from your laptop, so you can use any software you like.

The format for the projector is 16:9, 1920x1080 projection (FHD).

Video: ONLY GUARANTEED CONNECTOR IS HDMI. We will bring a USB-C to HDMI/LAN/USB-A&C mini-dock, but cannot guarantee it will work for your specific hardware even if you tell us the specs of your hardware in advance.

Presentation clicker: Also BYO, but we'll have a cheap one plugged into the mini-dock as back-up.

Internet: We'll have a hardwired connection at the podium. Note, internet connectivity at any venue can fail, so be prepared to give an "offline" version of your talk if you can.

### Tech Checks

We will schedule tech checks with you on-site prior to your talk. Please keep your eyes peeled for Google Calendar invites here.

### Emcee

Jason Lengstorf is your emcee. He'll connect with you separately to get some info for your intro as well as any other info he needs to help your talk be successful.

### Accessibility and Accomodations

The podium and stage should be accessible for a variety of physical needs. But just to be sure, if you need specific physical accommodations for stage access or equipment access, please make sure we know.

### Audience Interaction

If you plan to interact with the audience--taking questions, asking questions, taking suggestions--remember that the audience members probably won't get picked up by a microphone. Practice repeating what you'd expect an audience member to say to you so both the in-person and online audiences are sure to know what was said.

### Sharing Slides

If you want to share your slides (recommended) with attendees after your talk, put them on your GitHub or blog and share the link on your last or second to last slide.
