We're using an app called Orca Scan for lead capture at this year's event. Attendee badges will have a QR code printed on each side. To save an attendee's information, you'll just need to scan their badge. Below is some information on how to get set up and use the app. 

<h2 id="setup">Set Up Orca Scan</h2>

Here are just a few steps to get set up:

1. Accept the email invitation from hello@orcascan.com.
2. Download the [Orca Scan Mobile App](https://orcascan.com/mobile) to your iPhone or Android device.
3. Log into the app using the same username and password you created when you accepted the email invitation.
3. Test your set up!

<h2 id="test">Test Orca Scan</h2>

Follow these steps to make sure that you're set up up correctly:

1. Select the "SCAN" button at the bottom of the app, then scan the test QR code below.
2. Once you've scanned the QR code you'll see the test attendee's data.
3. Click on the Notes field and add some notes (optional).
4. Select the "Save & Close" button.
5. An attendee named Sasquatch Bigfoot should now be in your list of leads.

<h2 id="add">Add an Attendee Manually</h2>

Attendees who registered for the conference after Sept 9 will **not** have a QR code on their badge, but you can add them to your list manually. To do so, just select the + icon in the upper left hand corner of the app, click each field to enter the attendee's information, and select the "Save & Close" button.

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

The Local tab in your Orca Scan app displays attendees scanned on your specific device, allowing for offline access to data. The Cloud tab shows all scans from every user and device connected to your Orca Scan sheet, providing a unified view of everyone your team scanned at CascadiaJS.

To export your data, select the Export button. You can do this on your mobile device or laptop. Data can be downloaded to Excel, CSV, and other formats.
