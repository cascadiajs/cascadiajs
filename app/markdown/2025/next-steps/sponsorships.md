<h2 id="booths">Booths & Lead Capture</h2>

All sponsor booths will be located in the main lobby. When you arrive, look for a table with your company's name on it. 

Diamond and Platinum booths consist of 2 6-foot tables and four chairs, and have access to a power outlet. 

All other booths consist of a single 6-foot table and two chairs, and have access to a power outlet. We will provide 32" monitors for all booths that will fit on your table. You can rent additional external monitors (see below).

Sponsors need to provide their own branded linens for tables.

We recommend that booth sponsors bring a single, pop-up banner to place alongside their booth (see photo below). Diamond and Platinum sponsors will have space for an additional or larger banner.

Recommended booth times are 8:00am - 6:00pm on September 18th and 19th.

### Lead Capture

<h2 id="registration">Registration</h2>

Pick up your badge at the Welcome Reception on September 17th, or on the morning of September 18th when you arrive to set up your booth. If you have team members who are arriving later, conference staff will be available to check them in at any point during the conference. 

### Welcome Reception & Pre-Registration

The Welcome Reception is an opportunity for folks to pre-register, get their badge and conference hoodie, and hang out with fellow attendees! We encourage sponsors to attend, grab their badge, and have fun.

<h2 id="raffle">Raffle</h2>

To encourage attendee engagement at sponsor booths we're running a scavenger hunt/raffle. Attendees will need to visit all of the participating sponsor booths and do a few extra things to qualify to win a prize. In order to participate, sponsors need to provide a prize. We recommend prizes in the $100-300 range. Some recent examples are Apple Airpod Pros, a [Lego set](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/dune-atreides-royal-ornithopter-10327?gclid=Cj0KCQjwsPCyBhD4ARIsAPaaRf0GEwUAbr5nlu8_h8_QYmg93oG0U9kGH-Kp1GGNOPk6RdiaK058rDMaAiyWEALw_wcB&ef_id=Cj0KCQjwsPCyBhD4ARIsAPaaRf0GEwUAbr5nlu8_h8_QYmg93oG0U9kGH-Kp1GGNOPk6RdiaK058rDMaAiyWEALw_wcB%3AG%3As&s_kwcid=AL%21790%213%21695971563321%21%21%21g%21%21%2121172147888%21158672194057&cmp=KAC-INI-GOOGUS-GO-US_GL-EN-BR-PS-CONSIDER-ESCAPE-ICONS-SHOP-GP-DSA-RN-CIDNA00000-ICONS_DSA&gad_source=1), and [Looking Glass Go](https://checkout.lookingglassfactory.com/products/looking-glass-go).

If you're participating in the raffle, please plan on presenting your prize to the winner on stage at the closing on Day 2 (at 6:00pm).

We'll share contact info for every attendee who participates in the raffle following the event.

<h2 id="swag">Swag</h2>

Diamond, Platinum, Gold and Silver sponsors can show off their brand by including 1 small swag item or stickers that we'll place in bags and give to attendees. This is optional. The items need to be provided to CascadiaJS organizers (at the registration table) by 7:00 am on September 18th so we can bag them up before attendees arrive. 

<h2 id="video">Video Clips</h2>

Diamond, Platinum and Gold sponsors can provide a video clip (no longer than 2 minutes) that promotes their company and products. This video will be played during the live event. [Here's an example](https://cascadiajs.com/2024/sponsors/temporal) from our 2024 event.

[Use this link](https://www.dropbox.com/request/eMb2yLATY7HIue3cz5yT) to submit your video.

<h2 id="discord">Discord</h2>

[Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/kkYR86GM29) to engage with attendees who are watching the live stream. Hiring? Post jobs in the #jobs channel!
