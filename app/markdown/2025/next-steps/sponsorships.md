<h2 id="booths">Booths & Lead Capture</h2>

All sponsor booths will be located in the main lobby. When you arrive, look for a table with your company's name on it. 

Diamond and Platinum booths consist of 2 6-foot tables and four chairs, and have access to a power outlet. 

Gold booths consist of a single 6-foot table and two chairs, and have access to a power outlet. 

Sponsors need to provide their own linens for tables.

We recommend that Gold sponsors bring a single, pop-up banner to place alongside their booth (see photo below). Diamond and Platinum sponsors will have space for an additional banner.

Recommended booth times are 8:00am - 6:00pm.

<h2 id="raffle">Raffle</h2>

To encourage attendee engagement at sponsor booths we're running a scavenger hunt/raffle. Attendees will need to visit all of the participating sponsor booths and do a few extra things to qualify to win a prize. We'll share contact info for every attendee who participates in the raffle following the event.

If you're participating in the raffle, please plan on presenting your prize to the winner on stage at the closing on Day 2 (at 6:00pm).

<h2 id="swag">Swag</h2>

Diamond, Platinum, Gold and Silver sponsors can show off their brand by including 1 small swag item or stickers that we'll place in bags and give to attendees. This is optional. The items need to be provided to CascadiaJS organizers (at the registration table) by 7:00 am on September 18th so we can bag them up before attendees arrive. 

<h2 id="video">Video Clips</h2>

Diamond, Platinum and Gold sponsors can provide a video clip (no longer than 2 minutes) that promotes their company and products. This video will be played during the live event and on the livestream. [Here's an example](https://cascadiajs.com/2024/sponsors/temporal) from our 2024 event.

[Use this link](https://www.dropbox.com/request/eMb2yLATY7HIue3cz5yT) to submit your video.

<h2 id="discord">Discord</h2>

[Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/kkYR86GM29) to engage with attendees who are watching the live stream. Hiring? Post jobs in the #jobs channel!
