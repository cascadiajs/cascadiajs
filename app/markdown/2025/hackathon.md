## Technical Resources

### Langflow

Langflow is a powerful tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows. It provides developers with both a visual authoring experience and built-in API and MCP servers that turn every workflow into a tool that can be integrated into applications built on any framework or stack. Langflow comes with batteries included and supports all major LLMs, vector databases and a growing library of AI tools.

### AG2

AG2 (formerly AutoGen) is an open-source framework for building AI
agents and facilitating cooperation among multiple agents to solve
complex tasks. It addresses the problem of LLM attention limits with
rich context by creating AI workflows where multiple specialized
agents focus on specific subsets of the problem. Think of it as
enabling you to build a team of AI agents that can work together to
plan, solve problems, and collaboratively critique solutions.

To get started, take a look at the documentation at
[here](https://docs.ag2.ai/latest/). If you need help, join the [AG2
Discord support
channel](https://discord.com/channels/1153072414184452236/1157397569375309864).

Hackathon participants get access to a [new
portal](https://next.ag2.ai/), which enables developers to explore
jobs for agents, build agents, submit job results, and receive
payments in the future.
