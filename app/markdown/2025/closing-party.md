## What’s Where

**Karaoke (🎤)** all night. Sign up on the sheet near the door; be kind, be loud, cheer for strangers.

### Camp Fire — Floor 2 & 3

Keeping the spirit of **[Cascadia Connect](https://cascadiajs.com/2025/connect)** and the hallway track from the **[Schedule](https://cascadiajs.com/2025/schedule)**:

- **Birds of a Feather tables (🦜)** — find your topic, pull up a chair.  
- **Low-key games (🎲)** — take a breather between songs.  
- **Talk debriefs (💡)** — share your favorite moments, trade ideas, sketch demos.  
- **Sasquatch chats (🧭🐾)** — where and how would *you* find Bigfoot in the PNW?

Space usage:

- **Lobby (Floor 2)** — open seating for convos and BOAF tables.  
- **Great Hall Level (Floor 3)** — quiet(er) connection space. **No food or drinks allowed** up here — thank you!

## Friendly Reminders

- Be excellent to each other.  
- Respect lines, volunteers, and volume in shared spaces.  
- If you need help, look for staff/volunteers with badges.

See you on the dance floor. 🪩
