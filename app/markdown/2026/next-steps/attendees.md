Use the button below to complete the registration process. You'll need the ticket reference that is attached to the email that you get from Tito when you registered. It is a 4 letter code followed by a number, like <code>ABCD-3</code>.

This will create your official CascadiaJS account and give you access to RSVP links for the post-conference Activity Day and more!

<h2 id="cascadia-connect">Make a New Friend!</h2>

Meeting new people at a conference can be tough. We want to make it easier. We launched Cascadia Connect - Pair Programming IRL to help connect you with another attendee during the conference — maybe at the Welcome Reception, over coffee, or just to swap notes between talks. Think of it as a low-pressure way to meet one cool new person. You don’t have to be a first-time attendee to join in — everyone’s welcome!
