**We'll contact people who have been awarded scholarships by April 17th.** 

If you are able, feel free to purchase a special [at-cost Scholarship Ticket](https://ti.to/event-loop/cascadiajs-2026/with/kwtf84xgexm). This pricing is available to anyone who qualifies for our Scholarship Program and has filled-out our Application. Please do not share this link with folks outside of the Application process.
