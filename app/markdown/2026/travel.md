<h2 id="to-usa">Traveling to the USA</h2>

Traveling to the United States isn't as easy as it used to be, and that's unfortunate. Here are some guides on how to get here and get home safely.

ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ [Travel from Canada to the United States](https://travel.gc.ca/destinations/united-states) 

ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ [Entering the U.S. from Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Bermuda](https://www.usa.gov/from-canada-mexico-caribbean)

In our experience, the most important advice we give people is to be clear they:

* Are traveling for an educational conference
* Have proof of lodging
* Have a defined return date
