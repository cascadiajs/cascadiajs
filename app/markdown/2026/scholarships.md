CascadiaJS exists to educate and grow the JavaScript community in the Pacific Northwest. We're constantly seeking new ways to make our community broader and more inclusive, so we're excited to work with our community to fund this year's Opportunity Scholarship Program.

## Requirements

The Opportunity Scholarship Program is open to anyone who:

```
1. Lives in the Pacific Northwest, and

2. Is able to attend both days of the conference (June 1 and 2), and

3. Meets -one- of the following:

    a. Is a member of an under-represented minority (URM) in tech

    b. Has financial constraints that make purchasing a ticket a blocker

    c. Is currently unemployed due to a recent layoff or downsizing
```

Thanks to a generous donation from [Greg Bulmash](https://bulmash.com/), we have some scholarships available for people who are recently unemployed due to layoffs/downsizing. From Greg:

"Getting laid off is depressing, isolating, and financially difficult. CascadiaJS has long been a source of inspiration and community for me. This grant is intended to buy tickets for developers who are currently unemployed due to a layoff / downsizing within the last couple of years. The intent is to give you a distraction from worrying, build your confidence and your community, and send you home with new knowledge and a bunch of new friends and acquaintances."


## How it works

<i class="fas fa-pen-field"></i> Apply for a Scholarship by <span class="highlight warning">April 14</span>

<i class="fas fa-ticket-alt"></i> You will be offered a Scholarship Ticket at a discounted rate

<i class="fas fa-heart"></i> If you cannot afford this ticket, you can request financial aid. Applicants that are selected for financial aid will be offered a fully loaded ticket for $15. 

Why $15? A small fee helps reduce no-shows and ensures scholarship tickets go to attendees who are able to participate, allowing us to offer more scholarships to the community. If cost is a barrier, please reach out.
