CascadiaJS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or religion (or lack thereof). CascadiaJS does not tolerate harassment of conference participants or staff at any time nor in any form.

All communication throughout the conference (both online and in-person) should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any part of the conference, particularly when interfacing with any chat features built in to the conference experience. Please be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees and behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for CascadiaJS.

Anyone violating these guidelines may be removed from the conference at our sole sole discretion and will not have a right to a refund if applicable.

Thank you for helping make CascadiaJS a welcoming, friendly event for all.

## Purpose

A primary goal of CascadiaJS is to be inclusive to the largest number of attendees, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, CascadiaJS is committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming virtual environment for all, regardless of gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or religion (or lack thereof). CascadiaJS does not tolerate harassment of conference attendees in any form.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

Please help us create a safe and positive experience for everyone who attends.

## Expected Behavior

Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.

- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing comments.
- Be mindful of your fellow attendees and alert an Organizer if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or someone violating this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech and comments, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of CascadiaJS.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to, harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, race, religion (or lack thereof), disability, inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images (including presentation slides), deliberate intimidation, stalking or following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

CascadiaJS will not tolerate any unacceptable behavior from any attendee or other participant, including sponsors, speakers, and those with decision-making authority.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If an attendee or other participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from CascadiaJS without warning (and without refund if applicable).

## If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify an Organizer (anyone with a Staff badge) immediately in-person or file a report on our Discord:

- Discord channel #help-questions (tagging @Conf Organizer)
- Private DM on Discord to Carter Rabasa or Kate Pond

If you are experiencing a life threatening emergency, dial 9-1-1.
